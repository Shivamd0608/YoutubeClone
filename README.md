# YouTube Clone  

This is my very first project as a learner of web development. I have just managed to develop a simple clone of YouTube by just using HTML and CSS. It's an ultra simple static design with a replica of the YouTube interface.  

## What's in it?  
- A homepage that consists of navigation bar, video thumbnails, and the layout are super simple.
- Completely built with basic HTML and CSS (no JavaScript). 

## Why I made this
I created this project in order to get hands-on experience with the basic aspects of HTML and CSS. It taught me how to structure a webpage and style it for the better.

## How to check it out
1. Download the files or clone the repository.
2. Open `youtube.html` in any browser to see it in action!  


This was a fun project and a great way to start my web development journey!
